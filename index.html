            <p>Hey! My name is Mir Hossain.
                I am a web & font
                designer based in Bangladesh. I have been working as a freelance designer and front-end developer since
                2021.
                Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web design in
                college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical
                side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in
                translation.</p>
